# Earthquake App

This is the repo for the kartaca assignment. `Java Spring Boot` is used for backend, `Vue.js` is used for frontend.

## How2Run 

frontend and backend are implemented as one container since it is not a big application. You can run the project simply typing:
```
docker compose up
```
This command will build the images and run the container. You can access frontend from port `5173` and backend from `8080`.
